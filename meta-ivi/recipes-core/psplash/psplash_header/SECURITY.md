How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released
CVE number), please report it using the
[https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Security Security Bugzilla].
If you have a patch ready, submit it following the same procedure as any other
patch as described in README.md.

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please send a
message to security AT yoctoproject DOT org, including as many details as
possible: the layer or software module affected, the recipe and its version,
and any example code, if available.
